# Social-Media-Engagement-Analysis
In this project we explored data collected from Facebook to predict consumer engagement. The data  is gathered from the posts of retailers. We analysed the primary metrics used on Facebook to  measure engagement such as comments, shares and reactions. We also used this information to  train models to predict customer engagement.
